# Web Scraping Daycare List in Toronto
A common way to gather data off the web is to scrape it! In this project, use beautifulsoup to grab some daycare data off the toronto.ca website.

https://www.toronto.ca/data/children/dmc/a2z/a2za.html - a comprehensive list of licensed day cares in Toronto.

- Use some of new found web scraping and data analysis skills to help narrow down search for daycare services in Toronto.

- Use the python packages “requests” and “BeautifulSoup” in order to scrape the above URL to get the daycare name and address. Save the results into a pandas dataframe and save it as results.csv for later use.

- Pandas data frame should consist of the following info:

    - Name of Daycare
    - Address of Daycare
    - Daycare centre contact information
